Today I finish version 1 with a break-throw. I was able to render a specific dashboard based on the user that is logged in. This will allow for custom UI for each user. Prioritizing the user-specific needs will allow for more productive outcomes. Now I will start with developing each user experience; Admin, Service Advocate, Triage, Tech, SA Coach, and Filed Coach.
 

# Version 2 
The goal for version 2 is to be abel to create the user experience for all different users.

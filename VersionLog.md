## Friday April 22 2022
This morning, I successfully had the user change the data that is needed before submitting.  The correct value is added when the user selects a pre-screen outcome option. When the user changes the date, the new date is added. This will allow the user to select the correct pre-screen outcome before submitting to the data base.

## Monday April 25 2022

## Monday May 9 2022
6:30 am: This morning I code for 3.5hr. This time spent was an amazing. I was able to the update the landing page, create a log, and set up the command center dashboard. With the command center dashboard in place user in this role will be able to add new markets, roles, and proving questions.

## Tuesday May 10 2022
Last night I came up with an amazing idea. Currently, the user has to copy and paste the data to a form this is a very tedious task and slows the production of the user. My idea that solves this would be to develop a program that with one click gathers the data the user needs with the URL. This will have a big impact and the user will be more productive. Today I spent the morning doing reaching and will use the library to create this program. 
[Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)

## Wednesday May 11 2022
This morning I started designing the landing page. Although I did not get to code designing will speed up the process of development.

## Thursday May 12 2022
This morning I worked at the Command Center and added a section where users will be able to update their job status. With this section I would like to focus on code reusability. The goal is able to use the same function for all 4 different forms.

## Friday May 13 2022
This morning I mentored Alian and Javier on the frontend development. I know I did not get a code change, but both Alian and Javier can help with the front-end to speed up the product in the long run.

## Tuesday May 17 2022
This morning was a fantastic 3.5hrs of development. I was able to change the user's job status and job color through the pre-screening. I still need to add all data that a user can update, but the logic is working. I also realized the session will play a significant role in the user experience and updating data to the database. 

## Wednesday May 18 2022
Today was an amazing day. In the morning I was able to get the frontend code for the job comments. Later in the day after work, I was able to get comments into the database. Users can now add comments to a specific job. Now all I have to do is render the comments back to the user when the user selects a job.

## Thursday May 19 2022
Another great morning. This morning, I developed the ability to render the job comments to the user when the user added a new comment and when a user selects a job. I also test that other users can leave comments, and this is working as it should be. Today's day brings the project close to Alpha testing with the group.Another great morning.

## Friday May 20 2022
This morning was another fantastic day. I was able to polish the service advocate dashboard, and now it is easier for the user to navigate and read. I prioritize readability since this will be key in making the user more productive. I also work on designing the default colors for job status. This is the second key to marking it scuffle. Today keeps getting better. I was able to get the card's behavior working. When a user selects a card, the chosen card will resize so that the user can visually see what card they have chosen. I developed this by using cookies that keep track of the last card selected.

## Tuesday May 24 2022
This morning I was able to program for 2hr. I was getting the market from the user to the backend into the database and rendered it back to the user. Users can now add markets. I also started on job status and was able to reach the backend. 

## Wednesday May 25 2022
Today I was able to get the role, market, and job status to the database and render it back to the user. Now that these functions are working I can render the Job status to the user so that they can update the job status base on the default list. Developing the ability for users to change the status of the job will be fun and I am excited to implement this tomorrow.

## Thursday May 26 2022
This morning I was able to complete the behavior for changing the job status. Users can not see the window that will allow them to change the job status. Tomorrow, I will need to add the logic so that when a user selects a new job, status the database gets change.


## Friday May 27 2022
This morning I was able to develop the ability to change my job status. Users can now change any job status with one click. This is getting closer to being able to start the alpha testing with the team. 

## Tuesday May 31 2022
This morning has been incredible. I was able to get the updated job status feature working. Users can now edit the job status. This will allow me to move on to the next feature, with is the ability to filter jobs by job status. I can not wait to start developing the job filter.

## Wednesday Jun 01 2022
Today after work, I developed a reusable function that will keep the width of the card a user has selected larger than all other cards. I developed this function as reusable so that when a user updates the job status or any data, the card chosen by the user stays the same. The reusable function will allow the user to stay focused and not break concentration. The user will subconsciously know what job they are working on.

## Thursday Jun 01 2022
This morning was fantastic. I developed the front and reached the back end of the job status filter method. Users will soon be able to filter the jobs by the job status. Tomorrow, I will be developing the logic that will get the database base on the user job status selection. One thing I would say is my focus is code reusability. 

Today after work, I was able to finish developing the filter logic. Users can not filter jobs by job status. Which completes one of the major components functionality. 

## Friday Jun 03 2022
This morning I was able to get the front end of the search completed. I am now graving what the user has entered to search and will need to send it to the backend. After work, I was able to get the search logic working for a single search type. Users can now get results when searching by service job number. However, I need to find a way to have the user search any type of data.

## Monday Jun 06 2022
This morning I started the features that will allow a user to assign a Service Advocate after pre-screening. I was able to do the behavior so that after pre-screening the user will be rendered a component that will have a list of all the users in the job that was just pre-screen. Next, I will have to program the logic that will get all the users in the market after pre-screening.

After work, I was able to get the user in the market of the last job that was pre-screened. I just need to render the list of Service Advocates to the component so that a user can select and assign a Service Advocate. I will do this tomorrow.


## Tuesday Jun 07 2022
This morning I was able to render the user in the market and the market name after a user pre-screens. This is is a crucial step so that the job is assigned to a Service Advocate. Currently, jobs are not being assigned and jobs are being missed. This necessary step will solve this problem. Now that users in the market are rendering I have to program the ability of a user to assign the job to a SA in the market.

During lunch, I was able to reach the database and update the jobs service advocate name so that it can be rendered back to the user. Next I will have to render all jobs back.


## Wednesday Jun 08 2022
This morning, I completed the behavior and logic of the assigned user feature. SA users can now be assigned after pre-screening. This will increase productivity. I was also able to filter out any job that has a status of unassigned. Afterwork I was able to get the start coding the layout for where the job data will be displayed. Tomorrow I will working on the behavior.


## Thursday Jun 09 2022
This morning I was able to get the new layout for reading all the job information completed. The focus was to make it readable so that the user could quickly get to the data needed. The project is now ready for testing.

## Tuesday Jun 14 2022
This morning I started working on a feature that would assign a user after prescreen. After work, I was able to complete this feature. A user of the market can now be assigned after prescreening. This will help the scheduler never forget to assign SA to a job.

## Thursday Jun 23 2022 || Geo location and Search box
I  can not explain how happy I am this morning. I got the search box to render an address a user enters. The search feature will allow the user to see where an address is relevant to other jobs visually. I also got the geolocation working. With the geolocation, we will be able to see the exact location of where the tech is.


## Thursday Jun 23 2022 || Render Multiple Markers
This morning was an incredible moment. I got multiple addresses to render on the Google Maps API. Being able to render various addresses will all us to visually display the jobs running the day of the apt. I am overwhelmed with happiness to see this feature come to fruition. All the code is on a testing repository and can not wait to implement this on the application.

## Thursday Jun 30 2022 || Covert text format and Render Multiple Markers
Today at lunch, I was able to finish developing the converter algorithm. With this algorithm, I can take a textual value address and convert it to longitude and latitude coordinates. After work, I create the algorithm that renders all the address's to the map. The code is currently in another repository, and I must bring the code to the application. Today was a fantastic day and a perfect way to end the month.


# Deployment || Amazon Server
## Saturday April 17 2022
This morning I was able to deploy the CRM to Amazon Web Server it is live in this [link](http://44.201.184.202/Dashboard). I am excited now that project is on a live sever I can push a new update to the server.

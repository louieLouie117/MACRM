Today I finish phase 1 with a break-throw. I was able to render a specific dashboard based on the user that is logged in. This will allow for custom dashboard UI for each user. Prioritizing the user-specific needs will allow for more productive outcomes. Now I will start with developing each user experience; Admin, Service Advocate, Triage, Tech, SA Coach, and Filed Coach.

## Friday April 22 2022
This morning, I successfully had the user change the data that is needed before submitting.  The correct value is added when the user selects a pre-screen outcome option. When the user changes the date, the new date is added. This will allow the user to select the correct pre-screen outcome before submitting to the data base.

## Monday April 25 2022

## Monday May 9 2020
6:30 am: This morning I code for 3.5hr. This time spent was an amazing. I was able to the update the landing page, create a log, and set up the command center dashboard. With the command center dashboard in place user in this role will be able to add new markets, roles, and proving questions.

## Tuesday May 10 2020
Last night I came up with an amazing idea. Currently, the user has to copy and paste the data to a form this is a very tedious task and slows the production of the user. My idea that solves this would be to develop a program that with one click gathers the data the user needs with the URL. This will have a big impact and the user will be more productive. Today I spent the morning doing reaching and will use the library to create this program. 
[Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)

## Wednesday May 11 2020
This morning I started designing the landing page. Although I did not get to code designing will speed up the process of development.

## Thursday May 12 2020
This morning I worked at the Command Center and added a section where users will be able to update their job status. With this section I would like to focus on code reusability. The goal is able to use the same function for all 4 different forms.

## Friday May 13 2020
This morning I mentored Alian and Javier on the frontend development. I know I did not get a code change, but both Alian and Javier can help with the front-end to speed up the product in the long run.

## Tuesday May 17 2020
This morning was a fantastic 3.5hrs of development. I was able to change the user's job status and job color through the pre-screening. I still need to add all data that a user can update, but the logic is working. I also realized the session will play a significant role in the user experience and updating data to the database. 

## Wednesday May 18 2020
Today was an amazing day. In the morning I was able to get the frontend code for the job comments. Later in the day after work, I was able to get comments into the database. Users can now add comments to a specific job. Now all I have to do is render the comments back to the user when the user selects a job.

## Thursday May 19 2020
Another great morning. This morning, I developed the ability to render the job comments to the user when the user added a new comment and when a user selects a job. I also test that other users can leave comments, and this is working as it should be. Today's day brings the project close to Alpha testing with the group.Another great morning.

## Friday May 20 2020
This morning was another fantastic day. I was able to polish the service advocate dashboard, and now it is easier for the user to navigate and read. I prioritize readability since this will be key in making the user more productive. I also work on designing the default colors for job status. This is the second key to marking it scuffle. Today keeps getting better. I was able to get the card's behavior working. When a user selects a card, the chosen card will resize so that the user can visually see what card they have chosen. I developed this by using cookies that keep track of the last card selected.
